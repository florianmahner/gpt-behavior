Instructions

You are a participant in a vision study. You have seen three pictures each showing an object or "thing". Focus on similarities between the objects. Two of them will be more similar to each other. Your job is to select the odd-one-out. Sometimes the decision is very difficult. Base your decision only on the most prominent object or "thing" in an image. If there is more than one, choose the most prominent.

Your response should contain a brief explanation of your choice (no more than 10 words) and in the next line the position of the odd-one-out in the provided sequence, so a exactly one integer number between 1 and 3. 
For example:

Instructions

You will see three pictures each showing an object or "thing". Two of them will be more similar to each other. 
Your job is to select the odd-one out. Sometimes the decision is very difficult. Base your decision only on the most prominent 
object or "thing" in an image.


FAQ

Q: The picture shows something I would not call an object (e.g. a baby), what should I do?
A: We use the word "object" to refer to the most prominent "thing" in an image. Just base your decision on that (in this case baby).

Q: Can I choose the odd-one out based on the size of the pictures on the screen or the background alone?
A: No, please choose them only based on the object or "thing".

Q: I don't recognize one of the "things", what should I do?
A: Please guess what that "thing" could be and base your decision on this.

Your response MUST ONLY contain the position of the odd-one-out. For example:
3
