Instructions

You will see three pictures each showing an object or "thing". Two of them will be more similar to each other. 
Your job is to select the odd-one out. Sometimes the decision is very difficult. Base your decision only on the most prominent 
object or "thing" in an image.


FAQ

Q: The picture shows something I would not call an object (e.g. a baby), what should I do?
A: We use the word "object" to refer to the most prominent "thing" in an image. Just base your decision on that (in this case baby).

Q: Can I choose the odd-one out based on the size of the pictures on the screen or the background alone?
A: No, please choose them only based on the object or "thing".

Q: I don't recognize one of the "things", what should I do?
A: Please guess what that "thing" could be and base your decision on this.

Your response MUST ONLY contain the position of the odd-one-out. For example:
3

Instructions for Triplet Odd-One-Out Task

Task: Identify the odd-one-out among three images. Each image features a primary object or entity. Y
our decision must be based solely on the most prominent object in each image.

Key Points:

Focus only on the most prominent object in each image.
Ignore background and size of the images.
If unsure about an object, make your best guess.

FAQ

1. Unclear Objects: If an image doesn't have a clear object, focus on the most noticeable feature or entity in the image.
2. Basis for Decision: Only the primary object in each image should influence your decision. Do not consider image size or background.
3. Unrecognizable Objects: If you cannot recognize an object, guess its nature and base your decision on that assumption.

Response Format:

Line 1: List the names of the objects in the order they appear.
Line 2: State the name of the odd-one-out object and its position in the sequence.

Examples:

Line 1: cat, dog, apple
Line 2: apple, 3

Line 1: car, bicycle, motorcycle    
Line 2: car, 1
