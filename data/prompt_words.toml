Instructions for Triplet Odd-One-Out Task

Task: Identify the odd-one-out among three words. Each word represents a primary object or entity. 
Your decision must be based solely on the concept or idea that each word represents.

Key Points:

Focus only on the primary concept of each word.
Ignore any associations or contexts beyond the direct meaning of the word.
If unsure about a word, make your best guess about its meaning.

FAQ

1. Unclear Meanings: If a word represents something unclear or unfamiliar, focus on what you think is the most likely meaning.
2. Basis for Decision: Your decision should be influenced only by the primary concept of each word. Do not consider external factors or additional contexts.
3. Unrecognizable Words: If you cannot recognize or are unfamiliar with a word, guess its most likely meaning and base your decision on that assumption.

Response Format:

Line 1: List the words in the order they appear.
Line 2: State the name of the odd-one-out word and its position in the sequence.

Examples:

Line 1: cat, dog, apple
Line 2: apple, 3

Line 1: car, bicycle, motorcycle    
Line 2: car, 1
